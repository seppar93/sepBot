## sepBot

built with [react-simple-chatbot](https://lucasbassetti.com.br/react-simple-chatbot/) allowing me to display my work to anyone that wants to see it in a strucutred and aesthetically pleasing manner. The bot will guide you though my projects.

## Motivation

I wanted to be able to display my work and information to everyone in a new fashion. I found the traditional website portfolio is either to clogged up with animations or simply barebone. I wanted something that was interactive that would make the visitor remember their interaction.
